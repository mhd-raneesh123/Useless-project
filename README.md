# Useless Hub üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Clash Wizards


### Team Members

### Project Description
Useless Hub is a whimsical collection of utterly pointless yet entertaining web apps. From bending time with a Mouse Time Dilation Clock, to making text unreadable with a Reversed Reader, and even measuring scrollbar ‚Äúemotions‚Äù with a Scrollbar Sentience Analyzer, this hub celebrates digital absurdity.
Mouse Time Dilation Clock ‚Äî The faster you move your mouse, the more it distorts time.
Reversed Reader ‚Äî Reads the text on a webpage backwards (because normal reading is too easy).
Scrollbar Sentience Analyzer ‚Äî Gives scrollbars emotions and a life of their own.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever felt your scrollbar looks‚Ä¶ sad? Or that reading text the right way is just too mainstream? Perhaps, clocks are too honest about time?
We saw these non-existent problems and knew ‚Äî something useless had to be done.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our answer: Useless Hub.
An all-in-one hub filled with absurd tools that solve problems no one faces ‚Äî from empathizing with scrollbars, distorting time perception based on mouse speed, to reversing readable text for no good reason. Completely unnecessary. Totally fun.

-HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Web Speech API (for Reversed Reader)
